# VGG-16 Brain Tumor Detection 
For my final year project
Python program for brain tumor detection using the VGG-16 CNN model. This project includes the creation of only an artificial intelligence model. The model created is used in the Brain Tumor Detection website.
## 1.About Project
The general aim of the project is to classify MR Images as tumor present or no tumor using MR Images. Tumor detection CNN model is trained using the model used VGG-16 VGG-16 pre-trained model.

$\textrm{Accuracy} = \frac{\textrm{Number of correclty predicted images}}{\textrm{Total number of tested images}} \times 100\%$

Final Results | Set | Accuracy | |:-:|:-:| | Validation Set | ~95% | | Test Set | ~93% |
* Accuarry: 0.930000
* Precision: 0.938776
* Sensitivity: 0.920000
* F1 Measure: 0.929293
* Cohens kappa: 0.860000
* ROC AUC: 0.930000
### 1.1. About Dataset


* NO - coded as 0  (There is no tumor)
* YES -  coded as 1  (There is a tumor)
